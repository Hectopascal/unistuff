sed used for regex replacement only (in this course)

sed -r -e "s/<regex>/<replce>/_"

group matching in sed:


([a-z]+)([0-9]+)

first and second match

eg. 's/([A-Z]+)([0-9]+)/\2\1/g'

'2' refers to second group ([0-9]+)
'1' refers to first group ([A-Z]+) 

---> first and second group switch around. (backslash used to escape)


finger <name>
--> find zid
pp <zID/name>   OR acc <name/zID> 
-->info

xargs 
takes stdin and each line becomes command line argument

eg. with a list of many many names
---> xargs acc
this will list all details




mlalias COMP2041-list



symbolic linking:
ln -s <file> <shortcut>
-s means soft link
>>>>i.e if you rm <shortcut>, the original file will not be deleted

tilde does not expand in back tick e.g `~`

should use asterisk at the back
~/filedirectory/blah/blah/*


.*? << gives first occurence in regex (LAZY LIMITER)




$@ --> taken as array
$* -->taken as string

for x in $*
    prints entire command as string
for x in $@
    prints argument by argument

by default IFS is
IFS=' \t\n'
